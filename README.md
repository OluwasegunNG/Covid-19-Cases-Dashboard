# Project Name: Covid-19-Confirmed-Cases-Dashboard
------
# Project Objective: The objective of this project is to know the damaged caused on humanity by this novel disease  
------
# Data Sourcing: This Open Source dataset in Comma Separated Value(CSV) format was scraped from Github as URL and imported into Excel using the Get Data From Web, It was further transformed to Power Query. The first dataset is the Covid 19 global confirmed cases with 882 Columns and 286 Rows. The second dataset is the global recovered cases over 1000 Rows and just 6 Columns while the third dataset is the global death cases with over 1000 Rows and just 6 Columns as well.
------
# Data Transformation: Transformation was done through Power Query. In Data cleaning, i first of all removed the columns number from the data souce for easy syncronization of incoming data then i proceeded to Promoted Headers making individual columns names unique. I explored through the data and properly cleaned individually. I selected the needed columns and Unpivoted other columns. Columns header was finally renamed and after that i transposed my data by changing from text format to numbers and also to date format for the date. Data Merging was done to merge the three dataset into one single consolidated data.
---------
# Findings and Recommendation: I noticed global recovered dataset was last updated 2021 and the dataset is not up to date
